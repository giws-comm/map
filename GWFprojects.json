Most are located in the boreal forest on the Canadian Shield in the zone of discontinuous permafrost. The legacy of metal pollution from mining extends beyond the immediate mining sites and across the NWT via emissions to the atmosphere and subsequent deposition. However, its extent is poorly known. The fate and toxicity of these metals from mining activities depends strongly on their transport via dissolved organic matter (DOM). DOM is a complex array of molecules that play an influential role in dictating surface water quality. It is predicted that climate warming, especially in subarctic regions where substantial organic matter has accumulated over time, will accelerate both rates of organic matter decomposition and consequently the mass and chemistry of DOM entering freshwater systems during the next few decades. These changes have important implications for surface water quality with respect to long-term ecosystem health and human consumption of drinking water. Metals at levels comparable to guidelines for aquatic ecosystem health and drinking water consumption can result from enhanced metal mobility due to mining activities. Critically important to metal mobility is the production of elevated and potentially chemically altered DOM with wetlands, soils, streams, and lakes that have been a repository for elevated metal concentrations via atmospheric or direct deposition. Increased mobility of metals from anthropogenic sources, as well as those that are naturally occurring, in catchments and lakes in NWT as a consequence of ongoing climate warming has the potential to significantly expand the anthropogenic impacts of mining.", "URL": "https:\/\/specialprojects.wlu.ca\/samms\/"}, "geometry": { "type": "MultiPoint", "coordinates": [ [-114.4500116, 62.58332647] ]} },

Problems such as overuse and contamination persist despite decades of sustained attention from governments, researchers, international organizations and civil society. Improving governance is necessary, but the crucial role of external social, economic and political drivers and forces that operate beyond national borders yet impact governance within countries must be accounted for more effectively. Canada’s water resources and governance systems are subject to these drivers and forces. Some originate from within the larger water sector, but others are linked to decisions and actions in sectors operating at the national, continental and global levels that are not normally considered part of the water sector (e.g., energy policy makers, the banking and investment communities). Hence, in the same way that climate scientists need to understand how climate and water resources in Canada are influenced by continental and global climate drivers, those interested in strengthening Canada’s ability to respond to water challenges through improving governance need to better recognize and account for the crucial role played by external social, political and economic drivers and forces operating beyond Canada’s borders. <br> The overarching goal of the proposed research is to identify and assess social, economic and political trends internal and external to the water sector that have, or may have, implications for water governance in Canada, and to assess ways of adapting water governance in Canada to better account for those drivers.

The nature of Ice cover in large lakes is very different from that in small lakes in that (i) large lakes are typically only partially covered; and (ii) ice in large lakes is often fragmented and drifts around the lake under the action of wind. Simulations using two ice models, both of which include snow, will be carried out using the same hydrodynamic core, so that differences observed can be attributed to differences between the ice models, as opposed to the manner in which the hydrodynamics is represented. We will use the MITgcm as the hydrodynamic core. The first ice-model will be the ice-model included in the MITgcm. The second model we will use is the Los Alamos Sea Ice Model (CICE). Both large scale simulations of entire lakes and small scale process studies will be undertaken. The small scale process studies will focus on lake ice dynamics and convection near the ice edge and under ice. We will also add a Lagrangian model to simulate three-dimensional frazil ice formation. <br> The primary location of application of the model evaluation will be Lake Erie.

However, our knowledge of how climate change will impact the biogeochemical functioning and hydrochemistry of these source areas remains limited. We propose to elucidate the role of winter soil processes on the export of carbon (C) and nutrients (N, P, S, Fe) to the river network under changing climate conditions. The project builds on the hypothesis that spring pulses of dissolved organic and inorganic C and nutrients by these headwaters reflect the cumulative effects of microbial and geochemical processing of redox sensitive elements during the non-growing season. The project will advance the predictive understanding of C and nutrient cycling in soils of headwater source areas under seasonal snow and ice cover. The project specifically aims to improve our conceptual and quantitative understanding of changes in C and nutrient stocks, speciation and fluxes driven by variations in snow cover and freeze-thaw cycles. The data collected in laboratory experiments will be integrated into reactive transport and bioenergetic modeling to simulate the biogeochemical transformations of C and nutrients in winter soils under changing climate conditions. The data and insights gained through the proposed laboratory-controlled experimental and modeling activities will yield a better conceptual understanding of shallow subsurface biogeochemical processes and strengthen their representation in coupled biogeochemical-hydrological catchment models.

As an example, organisms living in Canada’s north and at high altitudes, must annually adjust their metabolisms and the lipid components in their cellular membranes to adapt to changing temperatures. Any alterations in the magnitudes or timing of changes in temperature or sources of food could have severe, even catastrophic, negative effects on individual organisms, and ultimately on whole ecosystems and the services they provide to humans. Also, nutrient cycling that controls eutrophication and associated harmful algal blooms (HABs) is controlled, in part, by organic forms of phosphorus and nitrogen and dissolved organic matter that can be better characterized by UHR-MS. <br>Natural constituents of surface waters, such as humic and fulvic acids, proteins and amino acids are important for regulating geochemical processes, but are complex and to date have not been well characterized.

Population growth in urban areas as well as agricultural practices and resource extraction tend to introduce pollutants such as nutrients, metals, microorganisms, pharmaceuticals, industrial waste products and other emerging contaminants into watersheds. These water quality issues are further exacerbated by climate change and other environmental changes in watersheds. There is a critical need to gain a detailed understanding of the effect of human activities on the ecosystem and water in particular. A crucial part of that strategy involves the use of sensors and sensing systems that can be deployed in the environment to monitor for the presence of contaminants and their variation over the short and long time scales. Although sensors and sensing systems for long term monitoring exist for many of the parameters of interests (such as dissolved oxygen, pH, turbidity, conductivity, nitrates), they are not sufficiently low in cost and require technical expertise for operation and maintenance. In other cases such as some metals, phosphates and bacteria, continuous monitoring systems have yet to be developed. In this proposal, we will focus on two broad areas. 1) The development of low-cost sensing systems and its implementation for long term monitoring of water quality parameters; and 2) The development of specific low cost sensors that are capable of detecting pathogens, heavy metals, oxidants and nutrients and integrate them with the sensing system.

The precipitation in this region provides the primary source of water for North American rivers going to the Pacific, Atlantic and Arctic Oceans, can trigger catastrophic flooding and it maintains the perilous existence of glaciers. Despite its essential role, very few observations that link surface features, precipitation and atmospheric conditions are available in this region. This project will start to address this gap by using a combination of sophisticated weather instruments, instrumented mountain basins and modelling tools to study storms and precipitation across the continental divide. One of the key issues is how much of the moisture flux crosses the barrier from either the Pacific in eastward moving storms or from the Prairies and Gulf of Mexico in leeside (upslope) storms. In particular, small-scale features of this moisture transport such as the distribution of snowfall, from for example, preferential deposition, will be addressed. To do so, both sides of the divide will be instrumented to measure precipitation fields aloft to study their evolution as they fall through the atmosphere on either side of the divide. The study region includes well-documented glacier sites as well as mountain headwater basins that were sources of the 2013 floodwaters in Alberta and British Columbia. This fills in the gaps of efforts to characterize the precipitation at the surface and snowline, in drought periods and will help determine their impacts on hydrology as part of GWF. Although our team is involved in GWF Pillar 3 projects (JT/RS: 2 projects, SD: 1 project and JP: 6 projects), none is obtaining any special atmospheric measurements or examining small-scale features of orographic precipitation.

SaJESS will fill gaps in the large effort placed on understanding cold regions processes characterizing the precipitation at the surface, snowlines, and their impacts on hydrology as part of GWF and may be the first GWF project based in a French-Canadian community. Critical transformative outcomes will be the development of conceptual, physically-based models of local and regional precipitation production processes over a relatively low terrain region that is especially impacted by highly variable cold season temperatures and associated precipitation phases that characterize its climate.
